# PyBer_Analysis
Analysis of ride-sharing data by city type using pandas and matplotlib libraries

## Background:
* Create a summary DataFrame with the use of Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib, of the ride-sharing data by city type. 
* From this summary, create a multiple-line graph showing total weekly fares for each city type. 
* The information can then be used by Pyber to make decisions based on the diiferences found in this study.

## Overview of the analysis:
Based on the analysis, we can see that fares in urban towns were much higher than both Suburban and Rural city's. Looking at the data, we can also see that urban city's had significantly fewer drivers. 

## Results:
Based on the results, we could conclude that that number of drivers as well as location has a significant contribution towards fares for ride-sharing. The rural city's could have a longer drive time per ride compared to urban and suburban city's as well as having a limited supply of drivers. 

## Summary:
Based on the data from the charts:
* Increase drivers in rural areas to learn more about the location
*  Look further into milage per ride, then compare between city types
* Look further into why customers are using ride sharing (going to work, social events, customer unable to drive) and how city type could affect the needs of customers
